This repository contains the documentation and an interactive Single-Page Application (SPA) demonstrating a comprehensive HTTP Load Balancing setup on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The project showcases how to deploy a highly available and scalable web application by efficiently distributing incoming traffic across multiple Virtual Machine (VM) instances running Apache web servers.

## Introduction to Load Balancing

Load balancing is a fundamental component in modern web application architectures. It acts as a traffic manager, intelligently distributing incoming client requests across a pool of backend servers. This prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck, ensuring optimal performance, preventing outages, and enhancing the overall user experience.

## Features & Benefits

This load balancing solution provides:

- **High Availability & Fault Tolerance**: Intelligent monitoring via HTTP Health Checks ensures traffic is only sent to healthy VMs. Unhealthy instances are automatically removed from rotation.

- **Concurrent VM Computing**: Efficient distribution of traffic across multiple Apache-enabled VM instances within an Unmanaged Instance Group, demonstrating parallel processing.

- **Comprehensive GCP Architecture**: Integration of essential GCP services including Custom VPC Network, Firewall Rules, Backend Services, URL Maps, Target HTTP Proxies, and Global Static IP Addresses.

- **Scalability & Performance**: A robust foundation for horizontal scaling, allowing for easy expansion and improved response times during fluctuating traffic.

- **Real-world Applicability**: Applicable to high-traffic scenarios like e-commerce, streaming, API gateways, and online gaming, where uptime and performance are critical.

## Interactive Explorer & Documentation

I have fully documented the entire process and built an interactive Single-Page Application (SPA) that visually explains the traffic flow, component roles, and setup steps. This SPA is designed to be a learning tool, making the complex concepts of GCP load balancing easily digestible.

## Architecture & Components Overview

The setup leverages several interconnected GCP services to achieve HTTP load balancing:

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) & Subnet**: Isolated network for resources.

- **Firewall Rules**: Control ingress/egress traffic (HTTP/SSH allowed).

- **VM Instances (Web Servers)**: e2-micro VMs running Apache, serving index.html.

- **Unmanaged Instance Group**: Logical collection of VMs for backend service.

- **HTTP Health Check**: Periodically probes VM health.

- **Backend Service**: Defines traffic distribution to the instance group.

- **URL Map**: Routes HTTP(S) requests to backend services.

- **Target HTTP Proxy**: Forwards client connections to the URL map.

- **Forwarding Rule**: Listens for external traffic and directs it to the target proxy.

- **Reserved Global Static IP Address**: Public, permanent IP for application access.

## Traffic Flow Workflow

The application handles traffic in a specific sequence:

1. **User  Access**: User sends request to the Global Static IP.

2. **Forwarding Rule Interception**: The Forwarding Rule captures the HTTP request on Port 80.

3. **Traffic to Target HTTP Proxy**: Request is sent to the Target HTTP Proxy.

4. **URL Map Consultation**: The Target HTTP Proxy uses the URL Map to identify the correct Backend Service.

5. **Backend Service & Health Check**: The Backend Service initiates Health Checks on associated Instance Group VMs.

6. **Traffic Forwarding to VM**: Traffic is forwarded to a healthy VM instance.

7. **Apache Response**: The VM's Apache server responds (e.g., "Welcome to Server 1").

8. **Load Balancing in Action**: On refresh, the load balancer alternates responses between VMs, demonstrating traffic distribution.

The primary objective is for users to access a single, publicly available IP address and receive consistently alternating responses, confirming effective load distribution.

    - You should see either "Welcome to Server 1" or "Welcome to Server 2". Upon refreshing, the load should alternate between the two messages.

## Common Problems & Solutions

- **VM Not Appearing in Instance Group**: Ensure VM is in the correct zone and network.

- **Health Check Fails**: Confirm Apache is running, path / responds, and firewall rules allow probes.

- **Static IP Not Showing**: Verify it's reserved as GLOBAL type.

- **Backend Service Empty**: Check if the VM group is unmanaged or unselected.

- **Load Balancer Not Forwarding Traffic**: Ensure firewall rule allows TCP:80.

- **Unhealthy Status of Instances**: Reconfirm correct port and request path in health check configuration.

- **URL Map Misconfigured**: Ensure URL map correctly points to the desired backend service.

- **Apache Not Installed or Running**: Use startup scripts for VM creation to install Apache.

- **Browser Timeout**: Verify VMs have external IP and Apache is listening.

## Future Scope

- **State-of-the-art Hotspot Mitigation**: Implementing advanced techniques to further optimize traffic distribution and prevent performance bottlenecks on specific servers under heavy, uneven load.
